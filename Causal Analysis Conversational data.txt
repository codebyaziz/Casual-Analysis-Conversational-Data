Causal Analysis and Interactive Reasoning over Conversational Data

1. Objective
Explain why specific conversational outcomes occur (e.g., Delivery Investigation, Fraud Alert, Escalation)
Provide interpretable, evidence-backed explanations
Support multi-turn analytical queries with context awareness
Focus on explanation, not prediction

2. Dataset
JSON-based conversational transcripts
Each conversation contains:
Transcript ID
Outcome label (intent)
Multi-turn dialogue with speaker roles
Each conversation treated as a single analytical unit

3. Preprocessing
Flatten conversations into a structured dataframe
Concatenate all dialogue turns per conversation
Preserve original turn structure for evidence extraction
Retain outcome labels for outcome-conditioned analysis

4. Core Methodology
4.1 Feature Representation
TF-IDF used to convert conversation text into numerical features
English stop-word removal
Fixed feature limit to control dimensionality

4.2 Outcome-Conditioned Statistical Explanation Framework
Uses Multinomial Naive Bayes as a probabilistic estimator: P(word∣outcome)
Extracts top outcome-associated keywords
These keywords act as interpretable causal signals

5. Query-Driven Causal Explanation (Task 1)
Retrieve conversations with the specified outcome
Identify dominant outcome-conditioned keywords
Extract customer dialogue spans containing these keywords
Generate structured explanations with evidence
Outputs include:Explanation text,Causal keywords,Transcript IDs with evidence spans

6. Multi-Turn Context-Aware Reasoning (Task 2)
Maintains last resolved outcome as context
Implicit queries reuse previous outcome
Explicit outcome mentions override context
Enables coherent multi-turn analytical interaction

7. Evaluation Principles
Evidence Recall: All evidence sourced directly from transcripts
Faithfulness: No generative models or hallucinated content
Relevance: Outcome-conditioned reasoning ensures query alignment
Deterministic and reproducible outputs

8. Implementation Details
Python-based, lightweight stack:
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn

9. Key Observations
Identifies dominant conversational factors per outcome
Produces interpretable, evidence-grounded explanations
Maintains consistency across multi-turn queries

10. Conclusion
Demonstrates that causal-style explanation over conversations can be achieved
Combines outcome-conditioned statistical learning with explicit evidence extraction
